 * providers that rate-limit lookups are asked once per stale payment and never
 * swept. Deleted in T2 once no session is left open.
 *
 * A provider that can be asked is asked, and what it attests is settled like
 * any other event; past the session's deadline it is still asked, daily, until
 * it gives its final answer. One that cannot — Paybox, Up2Pay — is never
 * guessed at: it waits a week for its IPN, then is closed as "no answer",
 * which is not expired or cancelled and lists the payment for finance to
 * check; a late IPN still settles it. A Stripe bank transfer is asked daily
 * for its whole window and cancelled at the provider when the window ends,
